//    Create a Vehicle class with two properties: a name instance variable and a makeNoise() method. The instance variable should be private and have getters and setters (in IntelliJ try cmd-N). The makeNoise method should just sout out a typical vehicle noise. Then create a more specific vehicle subclass, such as Motorcycle, Car, Truck, Tractor, whatever. Make the specific vehicle class extend the Vehicle class. Otherwise, keep it empty. Create a test class, perhaps calling it VehicleTest Instantiate the specific vehicle, assign a value to the name property and run the methods on the specific vehicle. Notice the inherited method works and the inherited name property is assignable on the subclass.


















//    public static char returnFirstCapitalLetter(String s){
//        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 1){
//            if (s.charAt(i) == Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(i))){
//                return s.charAt(i);
//            }
//        }
//        return ' ';
//    }

}

//    Create a method, returnFirstCapitalLetter, that takes in a string and returns the first capital letter as a char. If no capital letter is found, return a single space character ' '. Assume only letters in the input string and all possible inputs will have at least one letter.
//
//        Examples...
//
//        returnFirstCapitalLetter("hellO") // returns 'O'
//        returnFirstCapitalLetter("hello") // returns ' '
//        returnFirstCapitalLetter("hEllo") // returns 'E'
//        returnFirstCapitalLetter("hELlO") // returns 'E'
//        returnFirstCapitalLetter("H") // returns 'H'

//# Java Assessment Practice Problems
//
//        1. Create a class called Practice with a main method.
//        2. Create a public static method in main called *subtractTen* that takes one integer argument and returns that number minus 10.
//        3. Create a public static method *average* that takes an array of integers and returns their average as a double.
//        4. Create a class called Pet with two String instance variables, name and type.
//        5. Create getters and setters for the properties as well as a constructor that takes two strings and sets the name and type.
//        6. Create a PetDog class that inherits from Pet.
//        7. In PetDog, create a boolean instance variable, trained.
//        8. Write a constructor for PetDog that sets its name, type, and trained properties.
//        9. Write an instance method in PetDog  called isTrained that returns the boolean value of the trained property.
